TranslateGenerator
=========================

Python script to convert between CSV and Android/iOS localization files.

Uses Python 3.6.

Usage
-------
To convert from Android/iOS to CSV, use the importer:

```python TranslateGenerator.py -m importer -i <strings file> -o <csv file> -l <base language>```

`<base language>` could be `en`

NOTE: Do not edit the first line generated by the importer as the exporter will generate the folder languages based on that line.


To convert from CSV to Android/iOS, use the exporter:

```python TranslateGenerator.py -m exporter -i <csv file> -o <dir to save strings files>```

TODO

- iOS reader/writer
